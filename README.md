## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate engineer specializing in **Java, Python, and TypeScript ecosystems**, with strong expertise in **Spring Boot, Microservices, CI/CD, DevSecOps, and Cloud (AWS & Azure)**.  

My work focuses on building **secure, scalable, and efficient applications** while driving automation and observability in modern development environments.  

Most of my coding contributions are within company projects, which is why my public GitHub activity might look lighter than expected. The majority of my time goes into **enterprise-grade systems, security tooling, and platform engineering** at scale.
